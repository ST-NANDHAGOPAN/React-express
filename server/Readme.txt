Hi , Creating CRUD in Express js with MongoDB

useNewUrlParser: This option allows you to use the new MongoDB connection string parser. It is recommended to set this to true to avoid deprecation warnings.

useUnifiedTopology: This option enables the use of the new Server Discovery and Monitoring engine in MongoDB. It is also recommended to set this to true.
